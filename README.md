## commentary
I know you all think this.
Noise removal in point clouds is hard.

If you want clearer point clouds, you can de-noisb with CloudCompare, PCL, or Open3D using algorithms such as ROR or SOR.
However, most point clouds cannot be automatically removed as you wish, and I know many people who want a cleaner point clouds use Cloud Compare or other paid GUI software to manually remove noise.

I understand the difficulty of those who clean up large point clouds.
You know it's hard to manually edit a point clouds on a 2D display.
Poor perceptibility makes it time consuming and difficult to have confidence in accuracy.

This project is for that kind of people.
